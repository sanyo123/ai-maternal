# Data Ingestion Fix - Policy Simulation & Resource Allocation

## Problem
After uploading CSV files through the Data Ingestion page, the Policy Simulation and Resource Allocation pages were showing "No Data Available" even though patient data was successfully loaded.

## Root Cause
The CSV upload process only created patient records (maternal and pediatric) but did not generate the related **Policy Scenarios** and **Resource Allocations** data. These are separate data entities that need to exist for those pages to function.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes (`backend/src/routes/patients.routes.ts`)

Added two helper functions that automatically generate policy scenarios and resource allocations based on the uploaded patient data:

#### `generatePolicyScenarios()`
- Creates 3 default policy scenarios if none exist:
  - Enhanced Prenatal Screening
  - Mobile Health Clinics
  - Community Health Worker Program
- Adjusts the impact metrics based on the high-risk patient percentage
- Only generates if patient data exists and no scenarios exist yet

#### `generateResourceAllocations()`
- Analyzes patient distribution by region (using patient ID prefixes)
- Calculates resource needs based on:
  - Total patient count per region
  - High-risk patient ratio
  - Patient type (maternal vs pediatric)
- Generates appropriate allocations for:
  - NICU Beds
  - OB-GYN Staff
  - Vaccine Stock
- Falls back to default regional data if no regions are identified

### 2. Integration
Both functions are automatically called after CSV upload completes successfully, ensuring that:
1. Patient data is uploaded ✅
2. Policy scenarios are generated ✅
3. Resource allocations are generated ✅

### 3. Frontend Changes (`src/pages/DataIngestion.tsx`)

Updated the CSV upload handler to call `refreshData()` instead of just `refreshPatients()`, ensuring that all data (patients, policies, and resources) is fetched from the backend after upload.

## How It Works

### Upload Flow
```
1. User uploads CSV file (maternal or pediatric)
   ↓
2. Backend processes CSV and creates patient records
   ↓
3. Backend automatically generates policy scenarios
   ↓
4. Backend automatically generates resource allocations
   ↓
5. Frontend refreshes all data
   ↓
6. Policy Simulation and Resource Allocation pages now have data ✅
```

### Data Generation Logic

#### Policy Scenarios
- Based on uploaded patient risk profiles
- Higher risk percentages → greater projected impact
- Fixed set of 3 evidence-based policy interventions

#### Resource Allocations
- Dynamic based on patient distribution
- Regions identified from patient IDs (first 3 characters)
- Resource amounts scale with:
  - Patient volume
  - Risk severity
  - Regional distribution

## Testing

### Test Steps
1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. Login to the application

4. Navigate to Data Ingestion page

5. Download and upload sample CSV files:
   - Click "Download Sample" for Maternal CSV
   - Click "Download Sample" for Pediatric CSV
   - Upload both files

6. Verify the following pages now show data:
   - ✅ Dashboard (patient statistics)
   - ✅ Policy Simulation (3 policy scenarios with charts)
   - ✅ Resource Allocation (regional resource distribution)
   - ✅ Predictive Analytics (patient risk data)

### Expected Results

**Before Fix:**
- Dashboard: ✅ Shows data
- Predictive Analytics: ✅ Shows data
- Policy Simulation: ❌ "No Data Available"
- Resource Allocation: ❌ "No Data Available"

**After Fix:**
- Dashboard: ✅ Shows data
- Predictive Analytics: ✅ Shows data
- Policy Simulation: ✅ Shows 3 scenarios with interactive charts
- Resource Allocation: ✅ Shows regional distribution with forecasts

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `/backend/src/routes/patients.routes.ts`
  - Added `generatePolicyScenarios()` function
  - Added `generateResourceAllocations()` function
  - Integrated both functions into CSV upload endpoints

### Frontend
- `/src/pages/DataIngestion.tsx`
  - Changed `refreshPatients()` to `refreshData()` after upload
  - Ensures all data types are refreshed from backend

## Technical Details

### Policy Scenario Schema
```typescript
{
  scenarioId: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  maternalMortalityChange: number;  // Percentage change (negative = reduction)
  infantMortalityChange: number;    // Percentage change (negative = reduction)
  costIncrease: number;             // Percentage increase in costs
  implementationTime: string;       // e.g., "6-9 months"
}
```

### Resource Allocation Schema
```typescript
{
  region: string;
  nicuBeds: number;        // Number of NICU beds
  obgynStaff: number;      // Number of OB-GYN staff
  vaccineStock: number;    // Vaccine stock percentage (0-100)
  lastUpdated: Date;
}
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Allow users to customize policy scenarios** through UI
2. **Add manual resource allocation editor** for administrators
3. **Generate region-specific policies** based on regional data
4. **Add more sophisticated resource forecasting** using ML models
5. **Support bulk policy scenario creation** from templates

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Policy Simulation still shows "No Data Available"
**Solution:** 
- Check browser console for API errors
- Verify backend is running on correct port (5000)
- Clear browser cache and refresh

### Issue: Resource Allocation shows empty regions
**Solution:**
- Ensure patient IDs in CSV follow format with 3-character prefix
- Check backend logs for resource generation errors
- Verify patient data was successfully uploaded

### Issue: Data doesn't refresh automatically
**Solution:**
- Manually refresh the page after upload
- Check DataContext is properly set up
- Verify API endpoints are accessible

## Environment Variables

No new environment variables required. The fix works with existing configuration:
- `LOAD_DEMO_DATA=true` (default) - Loads demo data on startup
- Set to `false` to require CSV uploads for all data

## Notes

- The auto-generation happens **only once** when no policy scenarios or resource allocations exist
- Subsequent CSV uploads will not overwrite existing policies/resources
- To reset, clear the backend data files in `/backend/data/` and restart the server
- The generation is idempotent and safe to call multiple times
