## How to Upload

1. **Copy the CSV content above** (maternal or pediatric)
2. **Create a text file** on your computer
3. **Paste the content** and save with `.csv` extension
4. **Go to your app:** https://ai-maternal.vercel.app
5. **Login** with demo credentials
6. **Navigate to "Data Ingestion"** page
7. **Upload the CSV file**
8. **Check Dashboard** - should now show data!

## Quick Upload via Data Ingestion Page

The app has a "Download Sample CSV" button on the Data Ingestion page that provides these exact files. You can:

1. Login to the app
2. Go to "Data Ingestion" page  
3. Click "Download Maternal Sample CSV"
4. Click "Download Pediatric Sample CSV"
5. Upload both files back to the app

This will populate the system with sample data.

## Expected Results After Upload

Once you upload the CSV files, you should see:

**Dashboard:**
- Total Patients: 8 maternal + 8 pediatric = 16
- High Risk Patients: 5-6
- Risk charts and distributions
- AI-generated insights (may take a moment)

**Policy Simulation:**
- 3 pre-loaded policy scenarios
- Ability to simulate impact

**Resource Allocation:**
- 5 regional resource records
- Resource forecasting available

## Notes

- The system will auto-calculate risk scores using AI if not provided in CSV
- You can upload multiple times - new data is added/updated
- Data persists on the backend until server restarts (Render free tier)
