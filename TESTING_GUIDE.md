# Quick Testing Guide - Data Ingestion Fix

## ✅ Fix Applied Successfully

The issue where Policy Simulation and Resource Allocation showed "No Data Available" after CSV upload has been fixed.

## Current Status
- ✅ Backend server: Running on port 5000
- ✅ Frontend server: Running on port 5173
- ✅ Code changes: Applied and deployed

## How to Test

### Option 1: Test with Sample CSV Files (Recommended)

1. **Open the application**
   - Navigate to: http://localhost:5173
   - Login with your credentials

2. **Go to Data Ingestion page**
   - Click "Data Ingestion" in the sidebar

3. **Download Sample CSV Files**
   - Click "Download Sample" under Maternal Dataset
   - Click "Download Sample" under Pediatric Dataset
   - You should now have two CSV files:
     - `maternal_sample.csv`
     - `pediatric_sample.csv`

4. **Upload the CSV Files**
   - Drag and drop both files into the upload area
   - Or click "Browse Files" and select them
   - Wait for validation to complete (should show green checkmark)
   - Click "Process Data" button

5. **Wait for Processing**
   - You'll see "Uploading data to server..." message
   - Then "Data processed successfully" with green checkmark
   - This process now automatically generates:
     - Patient records ✅
     - Policy scenarios ✅
     - Resource allocations ✅

6. **Verify Policy Simulation**
   - Click "Policy Simulation" in the sidebar
   - You should now see 3 policy scenario cards:
     - Enhanced Prenatal Screening
     - Mobile Health Clinics
     - Community Health Worker Program
   - Click on any scenario to see:
     - Interactive charts
     - Impact over time
     - Cost-benefit analysis
     - Regional impact analysis

7. **Verify Resource Allocation**
   - Click "Resource Allocation" in the sidebar
   - You should now see:
     - Resource forecasting charts
     - Regional distribution graphs
     - NICU Beds / OB-GYN Staff / Vaccine Stock metrics
     - Resource allocation map
     - AI-driven recommendations

### Option 2: Test with Your Own CSV Files

If you have your own CSV files, ensure they follow this format:

**Maternal CSV:**
```csv
patient_id,name,age,risk_factors,risk_score,risk_level,last_updated
M001,Jane Doe,32,"Hypertension, BMI > 30",78,high,2025-10-11T12:00:00Z
```

**Pediatric CSV:**
```csv
child_id,name,birth_weight,gestation_weeks,risk_factors,risk_score,risk_level,last_updated
P001,Baby Doe,2.1,34,"Low birth weight, Premature",65,medium,2025-10-11T12:00:00Z
```

Then follow the same steps as Option 1.

## Expected Results

### Before Fix ❌
- Dashboard: Shows data ✅
- Predictive Analytics: Shows data ✅
- Policy Simulation: **"No Data Available"** ❌
- Resource Allocation: **"No Data Available"** ❌

### After Fix ✅
- Dashboard: Shows data ✅
- Predictive Analytics: Shows data ✅
- Policy Simulation: **Shows 3 scenarios with charts** ✅
- Resource Allocation: **Shows regional data with forecasts** ✅

## What Changed Behind the Scenes

When you upload CSV files now, the backend automatically:

1. **Processes patient data** from CSV
2. **Generates 3 policy scenarios** based on patient risk profiles:
   - Enhanced Prenatal Screening
   - Mobile Health Clinics
   - Community Health Worker Program
3. **Generates resource allocations** based on:
   - Patient distribution by region
   - High-risk patient ratios
   - Regional patient counts

The frontend then refreshes ALL data, not just patient data, ensuring the Policy Simulation and Resource Allocation pages have the data they need.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still seeing "No Data Available"
**Try:**
1. Hard refresh the browser (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)
2. Clear browser cache and reload
3. Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console tab)
4. Verify backend logs show: "✅ Auto-generated policy scenarios and resource allocations"

### Issue: Upload fails
**Check:**
1. CSV file format matches the expected schema
2. Backend server is running (check terminal for errors)
3. File size is within limits (10MB default)
4. Network tab in browser dev tools for error details

### Issue: Charts not displaying
**Solution:**
1. Ensure data has loaded (check Network tab)
2. Wait a few seconds for charts to render
3. Try selecting different resource types or scenarios

## Technical Details

The fix involves:
- **Backend:** Auto-generation functions in `backend/src/routes/patients.routes.ts`
- **Frontend:** Updated data refresh in `src/pages/DataIngestion.tsx`
- **Data Flow:** CSV → Patients → Auto-generate Policies & Resources → Refresh All Data

## Next Steps

After successful testing:
1. ✅ Policy Simulation is working
2. ✅ Resource Allocation is working
3. ✅ Data persists across page refreshes
4. ✅ All charts and visualizations render correctly

You can now:
- Upload your own CSV files
- Explore different policy scenarios
- Analyze resource needs by region
- Generate reports and insights

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the detailed documentation in `DATA_INGESTION_FIX.md`
2. Review backend logs in the terminal
3. Check browser console for frontend errors
4. Verify API endpoints are responding correctly
